Feature: Self-Description Lifecycle
  As a Federated Catalogue API consumer
  I want to manage Self-Descriptions
  So that I can create, read, and revoke them

  Background:
    Given CAT Keycloak is up
      And saved Keycloak token
      And Federated Catalogue Server is up

  @smoke
  Scenario: List Self-Descriptions
    When request list of self-descriptions
    Then get http 200:Success code

  # NOTE: 500 here means the FC server cannot authenticate to Keycloak's admin API.
  # The /participants endpoint calls Keycloak internally via client_credentials grant.
  # Check that KEYCLOAK_CREDENTIALS_SECRET in the catalogue environment matches the actual
  # "federated-catalogue" client secret in Keycloak (Clients → Credentials tab).
