Feature: Asset Provenance and Versioning
  Verifies that provenance credentials can be attached to asset versions, retrieved,
  and verified — and that adding provenance does not create new asset revisions.

  Background:
    Given CAT Keycloak is up
      And saved Keycloak token
      And Federated Catalogue Server is up
      And credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld" is not uploaded

  Scenario: Attach provenance credentials to versioned asset, retrieve and verify them
    When add credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld"
    Then get http 201:Created code
     And save asset id from last response
    When update saved asset with fixture "valid/version-control/gaiax-participant-v2.vp.jsonld"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When get saved asset versions
    Then get http 200:Success code
     And save asset version count and latest version ordinal
    When add provenance credential for saved asset at version 1 with predicate "prov:wasGeneratedBy"
    Then get http 201:Created code
     And save provenance credential id from last response
    When add provenance credential for saved asset at version 2 with predicate "prov:wasRevisionOf"
    Then get http 201:Created code
    When list provenance credentials for saved asset
    Then response has 2 provenance credentials
    When list provenance credentials for saved asset at version 1
    Then response contains saved provenance credential
    When get saved provenance credential
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When verify saved provenance credential
    Then provenance verification result is valid
    When verify all provenance credentials for saved asset
    Then all provenance verification results are valid
    When get saved asset versions
    Then total version count is unchanged
     And credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld" is not uploaded

  Scenario: Adding a provenance credential does not create a new asset version
    When add credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld"
    Then get http 201:Created code
     And save asset id from last response
    When get saved asset versions
    Then get http 200:Success code
     And save asset version count and latest version ordinal
    When add provenance credential for saved asset at saved version with predicate "prov:wasGeneratedBy"
    Then get http 201:Created code
    When get saved asset versions
    Then get http 200:Success code
     And total version count is unchanged
     And credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld" is not uploaded

  Scenario: Deleting an asset cascades delete of its provenance credentials
    # AssetDeletedEvent → ProvenanceCleanupListener removes provenance_credentials rows.
    When add credential from fixture "valid/default-only/gaiax-participant-correct-type.vp.jsonld"
    Then get http 201:Created code
     And save asset id from last response
    When add provenance credential for saved asset at version 1 with predicate "prov:wasGeneratedBy"
    Then get http 201:Created code
    When list provenance credentials for saved asset
    Then response has 1 provenance credentials
    When delete saved asset
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When list provenance credentials for saved asset
    Then get http 404:Not Found code
